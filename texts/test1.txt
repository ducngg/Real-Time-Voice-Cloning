This repository is an implementation of Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was my master's thesis.

SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.
